          <span>Hi Shaily,</span>
          <br />
          On this Rose Day, my care for you blooms like a beautiful rose in the
          garden of our life. Your presence fills my days with joy and warmth,
          just like the gentle fragrance of a rose. Here's to the bond that
          grows with each passing moment, much like the petals of a rose
          unfolding gracefully. Happy Rose Day, my dearest wife. I cherish every
          moment with you.
          <br />
